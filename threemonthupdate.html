      <p>
        Dear May,
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy 3 months of dating! From the first day I saw you in class to asking you out over text to you rejecting my first kiss attempt and us strictly holding hands for 3 months until today, we have come a long way and I am so blessed to have you in my life.
I just wanted to say that I am very content in our relationship so far and I hope we continue for many more months afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though we are long distance for the summer and I miss you so much, I still feel as close and connected to you as I ever was before. I love how we can talk for hours every week, get each other little gifts, get silly and send each other random reels every day. And I have never felt this connection before with anyone 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think one of the main things that make our relationship different is how we resolve conflicts with each other. This is the first time in a relationship where I have felt really sad whenever I don’t talk to you, and I think it shows how much I really care about keeping this relationship going for the long term. And whenever we do get into a fight we are able to work it out together, and I know we will continue to do so in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we celebrate these three months together, I feel confident for the future, and I am so happy to call you my girlfriend. This relationship is full of firsts for me. First time someone made me like holding hands, first time licking apples, first time doing PPP, first time getting lots of flowers, etc. And there’s no one else I would love to share more “firsts” with over the coming months. Here’s to many more months of love, laughter, and making unforgettable memories together. I can’t wait to see you again soon
      </p>
      <p>
        With all my love,
        <br>
        Timmy

      <p>
        Dear Timmy,
      </p>
      <p>
        yay it has been our 3 months!! i still find it funny how i met u in econ 3110 and how i decided not to drop the class because sophia introduced me to some friends (i dont want to be alone in a hard class u know). I am blessed to have you as my boyfriend Timmy. your round cheeks, your shy socially awkward face, your bubbly energy and ofc your retardness always make me smile every day :) Though we are doing long distance right now, I always feel connected with you and reassured about this relationship. I just love talking to you and even when we talk abt the most nonsense thing ever, I still genuinely enjoy it. Being around you brings me a lot of comfort Timmy and I have never felt like this with anyone before. I am never afraid of calling you right after I wake up out of bed or of talking to you about my very random overthinking moments. Idk I just feel like you really like me for who I am and I really appreciate it. Fights and conflicts of course happen sometimes, but I am glad we have gone through it together through talking things out. Idk I think it really helps us understand what we want and how the other can be better for each other yay.
      <p>
        Being with you helps me become better as a person too. I don't want to say too far ahead cause Im still improving but u do have a part in it :) So thank you for being such a great boyfriend to me, for being so understanding, and caring to me. And thank you for the cute gifts u gave me (and even after some failed attempts, u still try hehe). As I always say in my other previous love letters, I hope we will have many many many more months together with memories and laughters. And whatever happens, we can always go through it as a team yayy
